## Versions

### PlanSnap
A simple Materials Checker for Shop Orders. Load in the details and it will check the materials against the stock and give you a list of what you can make and what you can't - and the shortages if any.

(Potential to be depreciated. MinMax seems to do everything this does and more, but this is still a good tool for quick checks.)

### MinMax
A materials checker that min/maxes on various areas. Giving you the ability to focus on specific metrics.

### SchEng
A beta test of a scheduling engine that will allow you to schedule orders based on various constraints. This is a work in progress and will be updated as new features are added.

### InstSch
A beta test of an Instruments Scheduler. This does _NOT_ work currently and needs work. It is a work in progress and will be updated as new features are added.
